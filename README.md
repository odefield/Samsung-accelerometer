Samsung-accelerometer
=====================

Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 2014 with Galaxy S accelerometer data

TODO-list:

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
      of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    Upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE

Notes:
    - data needs to be tidy: Each variable you measure should be in one column, Each different observation of that               variable should be in a different row
    - run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory
    - README.md in the repo describing how the script works (what the analysis files did)
    - code book describing the variables (all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other       relevant information)
